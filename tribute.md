    <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Warren Buffett's life:</h3>
    <li><strong>1930</strong> - Born in Omaha,Nabraska. Warren Edward Buffett is born on August 30,1930 in Omaha, Nebraska as the second of three children to Howard and Leila Buffett, who married in 1925.

Buffett’s older sister Doris is born in 1928. His sister Roberta, known as “Bertie,” is born when Warren is three years old.</li>
    <li><strong>1942</strong> - Buffett buys his first Stock. After predicting to a childhood friend he will be a millionaire by the time he is 35, Buffett buys his first stock at the age of 11. Looking back, he laughingly tells CNBC, “I don’t know why I wasted that time beforehand. I got started late.”

Buffett pays $38.25 each for three shares of Cities Service preferred. It falls to around $27, then rebounds to $40, prompting Buffett to sell at a small profit.

It later tops $200 per share, teaching him a crucial lesson about the value of patience.</li>
     <li><strong>1952</strong> - Marries Susan Thompson. Warren Buffett and Susan Thompson are married in Omaha. Thompson had been college roommates with Buffett’s sister Roberta.

Susan’s progressive politics contribute to Buffett’s generally liberal views.

The couple start living separately in 1977 when Susan relocates to San Francisco to further her singing career.

They remain married until her death in 2004.</li>
    <li><strong>May 10, 1965</strong> - Buys Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire cautiously buys a small California-based candy maker for a fully-valued $25 million.

It becomes one of Buffett’s favorite investments, a “dream business” with strong brand loyalty that churns out cash and needs almost no new capital.

Munger recalls it as an important lesson. It is the first time they “really stepped up for brand quality. And it was a hard jump for us. We’d been used to buying dollar bills for 50 cents.”</li>
    <li><strong>1988</strong> - Buys Coca Cola. Warren Buffett loves to drink Cherry Cokes and he loves Berkshire’s investment in Coca-Cola.

At the end of 2017, Berkshire’s almost 10 percent stake in the company is worth $18.4 billion. That’s a staggering gain of over 1300 percent from its $1.3 billion cost basis.

Buffett credits the soft-drink’s company’s decades of advertising for building a “mindshare” that can’t be matched by competitors.</li>
    <li><strong>June 2006</strong> - Teams with Gates foundation to give away almost all his wealth</li>
    <li><strong>February 15, 2011</strong>
      At a White House ceremony, President Obama calls Buffett “not only one of the world’s richest men, but also one of the most admired and respected.“

Obama praises him for demonstrating that “integrity isn’t just a good trait -- it is good for business” and for “devoting the vast majority of his wealth to those around the world who are suffering, or sick, or in need of help.”</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Buffett annoys cryptocurrency enthusiasts worldwide when he warns long-term investors to stay away from bitcoin, predicting “in terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending.</p>
